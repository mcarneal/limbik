Limbik Data Analysis:


This application was designed to parse and read a JSON file consisting of targeted facebook posts from the 2016 presidaential election designed to interup the electoral process. 

This application is built with a front-end based in react and backend built with node. 

The front-end was built with the following packages:


Front-end:
:React
:Material and semantic UI -Semanitc UI was used for production purposes. The only features of Semanitc are the inital button placements. In the next build semantic will be replaced with only Material UI elements.
 

Backend:
Node and Express were used to serve the JSON file to the frontend. 



Installation Instructions:

This file is broken into Two directories: Limbik-frontend and Limbik Backend.
From the Backend folder run a Node index.js to begin the Express Server. By default this will run on localhost 3000:

From the Front end directory run NPM start to begin the React App. if the React app attempts to run on localhost 3000 a warning will appear asking to start on 3001. Press yes.

You can now begin your inspection of the 2016 facebook fake news posts in a visually appealing method. 






This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
